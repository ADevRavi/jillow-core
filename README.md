jillow-core
===========

Download [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/).

Run:
```
$ mvn clean install
```
Java library using [Zillow's API](http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm).

You'll need to sign up to obtain a [Zillow Web Services ID, ZWSID](http://www.zillow.com/webservice/Registration.htm).

Zillow's response results are returned in XML format.  This project will convert that XML into JSON using [JSON-Java](https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java).

_This project is still in development (in the process of adding additional API call that zillow offers), so please submit through github project pages any issues or requests._

Thanks for reading!
